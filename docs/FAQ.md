# Common Issues ❓

### 1. Why does Xiaozhi recognize many Korean, Japanese, and English words when I speak? 🇰🇷

Suggestion: Check if `models/SenseVoiceSmall` already has the `model.pt`
file. If not, you need to download it. See here [Download speech recognition model file](Deployment.md#model-files)

### 2. Why does "TTS task error file does not exist" appear? 📁

Suggestion: Check if you have correctly installed the `libopus` and `ffmpeg` libraries using `conda`.

If not installed, install them:

```
conda install conda-forge::libopus
conda install conda-forge::ffmpeg
```

### 3. TTS often fails and times out ⏰

Suggestion: If `EdgeTTS` often fails, first check if you are using a proxy (VPN). If you are, try closing the proxy and try again;  
If you are using Volcano Engine's Doubao TTS, when it often fails, it is recommended to use the paid version, because the test version only supports 2 concurrent connections.

### 4. WiFi can connect to self-built server, but 4G mode cannot connect 🔐

Reason: Brother Xia's firmware requires secure connection in 4G mode.

Solution: Currently there are two methods to solve this. Choose one:

1. Modify the code. Refer to this video to solve it: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18MfTYoE85

2. Use nginx to configure SSL certificate. Refer to the tutorial: https://icnt94i5ctj4.feishu.cn/docx/GnYOdMNJOoRCljx1ctecsj9cnRe

### 5. How to improve Xiaozhi's dialogue response speed? ⚡

This project's default configuration is a low-cost solution. It is recommended for beginners to first use the default free model to solve the "can run" problem, then optimize for "run fast".  
If you need to improve response speed, you can try replacing each component. Since version `0.5.2`, the project supports streaming configuration. Compared to earlier versions, response speed has improved by about `2.5 seconds`, significantly improving user experience.

| Module Name | Entry-level All-Free Setup | Streaming Configuration |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ASR (Speech Recognition) | FunASR (Local) | 👍FunASR (Local GPU Mode) |
| LLM (Large Language Model) | ChatGLMLLM (Zhipu glm-4-flash) | 👍AliLLM(qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507) or 👍DoubaoLLM(doubao-1-5-pro-32k-250115) |
| VLLM (Vision Large Language Model) | ChatGLMVLLM (Zhipu glm-4v-flash) | 👍QwenVLVLLM (Qwen qwen2.5-vl-3b-instructh) |
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | ✅LinkeraiTTS (Lingxi Streaming) | 👍HuoshanDoubleStreamTTS (Volcano Dual Streaming TTS) or 👍AliyunStreamTTS (Alibaba Cloud Streaming TTS) |
| Intent (Intent Recognition) | function_call (Function Call) | function_call (Function Call) |
| Memory (Memory Function) | mem_local_short (Local Short-term Memory) | mem_local_short (Local Short-term Memory) |

If you care about the time consumption of each component, please refer to [Xiaozhi Component Performance Test Report](https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-performance-research). You can actually test in your environment according to the test methods in the report.

### 6. I speak slowly, and Xiaozhi always interrupts during pauses 🗣️

Suggestion: In the configuration file, find the following section and increase the value of `min_silence_duration_ms` (for example, change it to `1000`):

```yaml
VAD:
  SileroVAD:
    threshold: 0.5
    model_dir: models/snakers4_silero-vad
    min_silence_duration_ms: 700  # If you have long pauses when speaking, you can increase this value
```
