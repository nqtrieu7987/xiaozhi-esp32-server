# Open Letter to Developers

"When the spring river warms, the ducks know first; it's the time when pufferfish are about to come up!"

Dear friends, I am John, an ordinary Java programmer in a company. Today, I write this open letter with the most sincere heart to you who love AI technology and innovation.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects, such as `Dify`, `Chat2DB` and other AI-related projects. I thought, how great it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "I have no way to serve the country, having coded for ten years in vain."

I came across Brother Xia's team's video in early 2025, and I was very curious about how they achieved it. I wanted to replicate their backend service and create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, the work I've done is still just an artificial idiot - it has low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

Brother Xia's team is our learning target. I really want to have an intelligent Xiaozhi backend service like Brother Xia's team. But I can also understand Brother Xia's decision not to open source. "A single flower does not make spring; a hundred flowers blooming together make spring full of gardens." The era of AI blooming everywhere may be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to realize a low-cost civilian Jarvis. I personally believe that what he can achieve, we can also achieve, it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to obtain the scriptures."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey to obtain the scriptures? I think there should be no less than eighty-one difficulties. Along the way, there will inevitably be various monsters, but there will also be immortals secretly helping us, and people joining the journey.

If you find the above content funny, then I also feel very lucky. I was able to make you laugh for five seconds out of the more than 30,000 days of your life, which can be considered a contribution to you.

Will this idea of a civilian low-cost Jarvis fail? I don't know, but isn't this kind of failure very common in our ordinary people's lives?

In the future, one thing is certain: someone will completely replicate Brother Xia's team's functionality and realize a civilian low-cost Jarvis. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to walking hand in hand with you to create the future together.

# Appendix: Development Contribution Guide
## Project Goals

1. **Civilian Low-Cost Jarvis Solution**  

2. **Intelligent Linkage Solution for Peripheral Hardware**  

## Join Us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join and contribute to the project together. You can view the features we plan to implement recently at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). Features in the list that haven't been assigned to anyone are urgently in need of your participation. Participation methods are as follows:

### 1. Become a Regular Contributor

Fork the project, submit PRs, which will be reviewed by developers and merged into the main branch.

### 2. Become a Developer

When you have accumulated 3 valid PRs, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join an independent developer group to discuss the project's future together.

## Developer Development Process

1. **Create New Branch**  
   Each feature point should be developed in a new branch. The branch name should be concise and clear, allowing people to see at a glance what functionality is being implemented, avoiding feature conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for Review**  
   After feature development is complete, please submit a PR on GitHub for review by other developers. After approval, it will be merged into the main branch.
